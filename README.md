# modeltrain-esp8266-oebbrailnet-sim
This code is for esp8266 and creates a wifi SSID "OEBB" to connect to.

I used it on a Wemos Mini D1 that we mount in a H0 model train.

Through a DNS server you can access a static image at the URL http://railnet.oebb.at. This simulates the portal of an Ã–BB Railjet (train). It is for use with model trains as you can install the ESP8266 in a model vehicle.

5 V Micro USB power is required in most cases. Any other powering option for your esp8266 will also work.
