# modeltrain-esp8266-oebbrailnet-sim
This code is for esp8266 and creates an SSID "OEBB" to connect to.

Through a DNS server you can access a static image at the URL http://railnet.oebb.at. This simulates the landing page of an Ã–BB Railjet. It is for use with model trains as you can install the ESP8266 in a model vehicle.

5 V Micro USB power is required in most cases.
